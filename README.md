Welcome to my Java Algorithms repository! This repository showcases my expertise in solving various algorithmic and data structure problems using Java. It is a collection of well-commented code implementations designed to demonstrate my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and understanding of essential programming concepts.

**Features**
  - Algorithms: A range of classic algorithms implemented in Java, such as Binary Search, Longest Common Prefix, and Fractional Knapsack.

  - Data Structures: Includes various data structure manipulations like removing duplicates from a sorted list, balanced parentheses checking, and finding contiguous subarrays with the largest sum.

  - Problem Solving: Solutions to popular coding problems, useful for job interviews and competitive programming.

**Problem Categories**
  - Sorting & Searching: Algorithms like Binary Search and Sorting Vowels in Strings.

  - Dynamic Programming: Problems like Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters and the Fractional Knapsack Problem.

  - Graph Algorithms: Solutions like Count Islands in a Grid.

  - String Manipulation: Includes problems such as Check Anagram and String Containing All Characters.

**Technologies Used**
J  - ava: All solutions are implemented using Java (version 8 and above).

**Key Projects**
  - Binary Search in Sorted 2D Array: Efficiently searching for an element in a 2D array.

  - Longest Common Prefix: Finding the longest common prefix among a list of strings.

  - Sudoku Solver: Solving the classic Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

**How to Run**
  1. Clone the repository:
    ```Bash []
    git clone https://github.com/Mridul-lucifer/JAVA.git
    ```

  2. Open the Java files in your preferred IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code).
  3. Run the individual Java files containing the main method for each algorithm or problem solution.
